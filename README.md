# Ruby on Rails with React.js Boilerplate

BUILD AN ECOMMERCE SITE WHERE PEOPLE CAN CREATE AN ACCOUNT AND SUBMIT REQUESTS FOR PURCHASING ITEMS FROM ME.




This is a boilerplate template for a Ruby on Rails app with a React.js frontend and PostgreSQL as the database. It provides a basic structure and setup to help you get started quickly.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following installed:

- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
- [Ruby 3.2.2](https://ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/)
- [Rails 7.0.5](https://rubyonrails.org/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) and/or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)


## Setting up tools and dependencies

## Install Homebrew (if not already installed)

1.  Open Terminal on your Mac.

2.  Copy and paste the following command and press Return:

        /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

3.  Follow the prompts to complete the installation of Homebrew.

Congrats! You have successfully installed Homebrew.

## Install RVM (Ruby Version Manager)

1.  In Terminal, enter the following command and press Return:

        \curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable

2.  Follow the instructions provided during the installation process. RVM will be installed to your user directory (~/.rvm).

3.  Close the Terminal and reopen it to load RVM into your shell.

4.  Type in the following command and press Return:

        source ~/.rvm/scripts/rvm

Congrats! You have successfully installed RVM using Homebrew.


## Install Ruby

1.  In Terminal, enter the following command and press Return:

        rvm install 3.2.2

2.  Wait for the installation to complete. This may take a few minutes, depending on your internet connection.

3.  Set Ruby 3.2.2 as the default version by entering the following command and press Return:

        rvm use 3.2.2 --default

    => Fun fact, macOS may already has a version of Ruby pre-installed so this is important!

4.  Verify the installation by entering the following command to check if Ruby 3.2.2 is installed successfully:

        ruby -v

    You should see the following output.

        > ruby 3.2.2 (<year-month-day>) [<your-chipset>]

Congrats! You have successfully installed Ruby version 3.2.2 on your Mac using RVM.


## Install Rails

1.  Ensure you have RVM loaded into your shell by opening a new Terminal window, enter the following command and pressing Return:

        source ~/.rvm/scripts/rvm

    This will load RVM into your current session.

2.  To install Rails, enter the following command and press Return:

        gem install rails --version=7.0.5

3.  Verify whether Rails was installed, and whether the correct version was installed:

        rails -v

    The output should look like this:

        > Rails 7.0.5

Congratulations! You have successfully installed Rails version 3.2.22 on your Mac.


## Install PostgreSQL

1.  In a new Terminal, enter the following command and press Return:

        brew install postgresql

    Wait for the installation to complete. This will install PostgreSQL and its dependencies.

2.  Start and enable PostgreSQL service by entering the following command and pressing Enter:

        brew services start postgresql

    This will start the PostgreSQL service and configure it to start automatically on system startup.

3.  Enter the following command to check if PostgreSQL is installed successfully:

        postgres -V

    You should see output similar to the following:

        > postgres (PostgreSQL) x.x.x

4.  Start and enable PostgreSQL service by entering the following command:

        brew services start postgresql

    This will start the PostgreSQL service and configure it to start automatically on system startup.

5.  Set up a password for the default PostgreSQL user (postgres) by entering the following command and press Enter to switch to the PostgreSQL user:

        sudo -u postgres psql postgres

    You will now enter the PostgreSQL interactive terminal. Now, set a password for the default user by entering the following command:

        \password postgres

    Follow the prompts to enter and confirm your desired password for the "postgres" user.

    Exit the PostgreSQL interactive terminal

        \q
    
6.  Turn on PostgreSQL service by entering the following command and press Return:

        brew services start postgresql

    This will ensure the PostgreSQL service is running.

7.  Check to see the version of PostgreSQL and verify the connection:

        psql --version

    You should see output similar to the following:

        > psql (PostgreSQL) x.x.x

8.  Now to verify the connection, type the following into your terminal:

        brew services list

    The output should look like this:

        > postgresql@14  started  user  ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.postgresql@14.plist

9.  Configure your Ruby on Rails app to use PostgreSQL by making sure the Rails app's `config/database.yml` file looks like this:

        default: &default
            adapter: postgresql
            encoding: unicode
            pool: <%= ENV.fetch("RAILS_MAX_THREADS") { 5 } %>
            username: postgres
            password: your_password
            host: localhost

        development:
            <<: *default
            database: your_database_name_development

        production:
            <<: *default
            database: your_database_name_production

    You *might* need to replace "your_password" with the password you set for the "postgres" user in Step 3, keep that in mind!

That's it! You have set up PostgreSQL, configured a password for the default user, and performed necessary steps to use PostgreSQL in your app. Remember to restart your Rails server or reload your app's environment.


## Install Node.js

1.  Open a Terminal window and enter the following:

        brew install node

    Homebrew will download and install the latest stable version of Node.js along with npm (Node Package Manager).

2.  To check if Node.js is installed correctly, enter the following command in Terminal:

        node -v

    You should see the version number of Node.js displayed, indicating a successful installation.

    Additionally, you can also check the version of npm by entering the following command:

        npm -v

    This will display the version number of npm if the installation was successful.


Congratulations! You have successfully installed Node.js on your Mac using Terminal. Now you can start using Node.js to run JavaScript applications and leverage its ecosystem of packages and tools.


## Install Yarn

1.  In Terminal, enter the following command and press Return:

        brew install yarn

2.  Check if Yarn is installed correctly, enter the following command in Terminal:

        yarn --version

    You should see the version number of Yarn displayed, indicating a successful installation.

Congratulations! You have successfully installed Yarn on your Mac using Terminal. Now you can use Yarn as a package manager for JavaScript and Node.js projects, leveraging its features and benefits.


## Installation

1.  Clone the repository:

        git clone <repository-url>


2.  Change into the project directory:
    
        cd <project-directory>

## yarn / npm 

Yarn and npm are both package managers for JavaScript and Node.js projects, but they have some differences in terms of features, performance, and compatibility. Here's an overview of the differences and when it's appropriate to use each:

Package Management:

npm (Node Package Manager): npm is the default package manager that comes bundled with Node.js. It has been around for a long time and is widely used in the JavaScript ecosystem.
Yarn: Yarn is a package manager developed by Facebook. It was created to address some limitations of npm and provide additional features.
Dependency Resolution and Performance:

Yarn: Yarn introduced a more deterministic dependency resolution algorithm, which ensures that the same packages are installed consistently across different machines. It also features a caching mechanism that improves installation speed, especially for large projects or when installing dependencies repeatedly.
npm: npm has made significant improvements in dependency resolution and performance in recent versions. It now uses a lockfile (package-lock.json) to provide more deterministic installations and optimize performance.
Package Registry:

npm: npm has a large and mature package registry called the npm registry (https://www.npmjs.com). It hosts a vast number of open-source packages for JavaScript and Node.js development.
Yarn: Yarn is compatible with the npm registry and can seamlessly install packages from it. It also has its own package registry called the Yarn registry (https://yarnpkg.com/packages).
User Experience and Features:

Yarn: Yarn provides a more modern and user-friendly command-line interface (CLI) compared to npm. It has features like interactive prompts, detailed error messages, and parallel package installations.
npm: npm has been continuously improving its CLI and provides a solid user experience. It offers a wide range of commands and features, including built-in scripts and package publishing capabilities.
When to use Yarn or npm:

Yarn is a good choice if you value deterministic dependency resolution, faster installations, and a modern CLI experience.
npm is a solid option if you prefer using the default package manager, want compatibility with the broader JavaScript ecosystem, and don't have specific requirements that Yarn provides.
Using Both in an Application:

In many cases, you can use either Yarn or npm for your project without any issues.
It's possible to mix Yarn and npm commands in a project if needed. For example, you could use Yarn for package installation (yarn install) but use npm for running scripts (npm run).
It's essential to make sure the lockfile (yarn.lock or package-lock.json) is committed to version control to ensure consistent installations regardless of the package manager used.
Ultimately, the choice between Yarn and npm depends on your preferences, project requirements, and team conventions. Both package managers are widely used and supported, so you can choose the one that aligns best with your needs.
